#  Bypass NRO on STEROIDS!?!?!?

From the OOBE Screen press Shift + F10

```
curl -L christitus.com/bypass -o skip.cmd
skip.cmd
```

This will skip the entire OOBE process including microsoft account and ANY questions during the setup process. It still allows you to select your language, region, and keyboard layout.
